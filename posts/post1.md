I started making this blog this week, it is my second attempt at making this blog. The first attempt failed after i couldn't wrap my head around the extensive gatsby plugin ecosystem. The blog uses [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) to generate a static website from markdown files. [Gatsby's website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/) offers a great tutorial on getting started to develop your own website. It can generate pages from a cms source or from your file system. As their website says it is the "One Front-end to Rule Them All".
